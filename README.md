# CHVRCHPOTATO

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

A text-based game about a lazy exorcist.

## The story

In his younger days, Father Ignavus was an accomplished exorcist. Now, though, he's in his 50s, grumpy, and tired. Exorcisms are **hard work**. Now, he spends most of his time thinking up plausible explanations for hauntings and possessions so he doesn't have to actually banish any demons. Sometimes his explanations are convincing; sometimes they're not. As Father Ignavus, keep up your credibility so you don't have to spend your strength!
